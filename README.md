# Numerosity-Based Categorization in Neural Networks

This repository contains the code, data and resources for my MSc thesis on numerosity-based categorization in neural networks. The project develops methods for classifying inputs into approximate categories such as **"few,"** **"medium,"** and **"many,"** where precise counts are unnecessary. These methods are particularly relevant to real-world applications—including crowd monitoring, traffic analysis and object detection—where approximate quantification is both efficient and practical.


## Description

Traditional counting methods typically rely on obtaining exact numerical counts, a requirement that may be impractical or unnecessary in many scenarios. In contrast, this research explores scalable and robust models that categorize quantities into broader, flexible categories. By leveraging concept learning and multi-modal approaches, the project aims to generalize across diverse input types—ranging from images and sequences to graphs—while maintaining both accuracy and adaptability.


## Key Challenges to address

- Input-Agnostic Categorization: Developing methods that abstract numerosity concepts independently of the specific input format or modality.

- Formalizing Category Definitions: Establishing clear, flexible definitions for categories like "few" and "many" using techniques such as fuzzy logic, thresholding, and density-based clustering.

- Multi-Modal Data Integration: Integrating various data sources to achieve a unified understanding of numerosity that is robust across different domains.

## Objectives

- Generalization: Train neural networks to learn abstract numerosity concepts that are independent of specific data formats or modalities.

- Scalability: Build models capable of handling diverse datasets and adapting to the complexities of real-world applications.

- Efficiency: Develop approximate quantification methods that are computationally efficient yet maintain high accuracy.
