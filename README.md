# Numerosity-Based Categorization in Neural Networks

This repository contains the code, data and resources for my MSc thesis on developing methods for numerosity-based categorization. The research focuses on classifying objects into approximate groups like "few," "medium," and "many," where precise counts are unnecessary. Applications include areas such as crowd monitoring, object detection, and traffic analysis.


## Description

Traditional counting methods require exact numbers, but in many real-world scenarios, approximate quantification is more efficient and practical. This project explores scalable and robust models that categorize quantities without needing precise counts.
