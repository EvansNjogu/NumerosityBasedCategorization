# Numerosity-Based Categorization in Neural Networks

This repository contains the complete source code, datasets and experiments accompanying my MSc thesis: **"Numerosity-Based Categorization in Neural Networks."**  
The project investigates how deep learning models can perceive and categorize quantities into abstract concepts such as **"few"**, **"medium"** and **"many"**, instead of relying on precise counts.

This repository contains the complete source code, datasets and experiments for the MSc thesis:  
**‚ÄúNumerosity-Based Categorization in Neural Networks‚Äù**, completed at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University (ELTE), Faculty of Informatics, and graded **5/5**.  
Supervised by Dr. L√°szl√≥ Guly√°s, the work is currently being prepared for presentation at leading AI conferences.

## üîç Project Summary

The project explores how neural networks can learn to **categorize quantities** (e.g., *few*, *medium*, *many*) without relying on precise counting.  
Instead of designing counting mechanisms, we evaluate whether models can form **abstract numerical concepts** from raw visual data‚Äîa skill humans and animals exhibit in approximate number sense.

This work evaluates both **CNN** and **CNN + Transformer** architectures across diverse synthetic datasets, aiming to uncover perceptual generalization and emergent biases in quantity estimation.

## üß™ Core Questions

- Can neural models abstract quantity across unrelated object types?
- Do visual cues like pixel ratio or clustering affect prediction biases?
- Can these models generalize numerosity across changes in object shape, occlusion, or domain?

## Highlights

- Developed custom datasets to test generalization under controlled variations (dot, silhouette, pixel-ratio).  
- Designed and trained CNN and CNN + Transformer models for numerosity categorization.  
- Demonstrated cognitive parallels between human and neural model perception (e.g., context-dependent numerosity biases).  
- Evaluated cross-domain transfer learning performance.  
- Successfully defended as MSc Thesis and now undergoing conference submission

## Usage

The repository includes:
- Dataset generation scripts
- Model implementations (PyTorch)
- Experiment runners
- Evaluation and visualization tools (confusion matrices, sample predictions)

## Datasets

This repository includes several datasets used for training and evaluating numerosity categorization models.

### Included in this repository (via Git LFS)

The following datasets are included directly in the repository using Git Large File Storage (LFS).  
They will be automatically downloaded when you clone and pull the repository (make sure Git LFS is installed):

```

```

### Not included: Within-Modality Dataset

The **within-modality** dataset (~2.74 GB) is too large to be included via Git LFS.

## Objectives

- Generalization: Train neural networks to learn abstract numerosity concepts that are independent of specific data formats or modalities.

- Scalability: Build models capable of handling diverse datasets and adapting to the complexities of real-world applications.

- Efficiency: Develop approximate quantification methods that are computationally efficient yet maintain high accuracy.
